# Developer's Guide

## What is Eslint?
[ESlint](https://eslint.org/) is a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript that performs static code analysis to find problematic patterns or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to certain style guidelines. Eslint uses the Espree parser to breakdown the structure of the source code into an abstract syntaxt tree (AST) [[1]]. The AST generated by the Espee parser is broken down into node types like "BlockStatement", "MemberStatement" or "CallExpression". As Eslint traverses the generated AST, it checks the code paths, these node types and selectors to report or fix potential problems specified in the rules defined in the eslint config.

## Shared Configuration and Rules
Eslint supports sharable configuraitons and custom rules. Configurations can be shared and extedend via `eslint-config-*` configuration modules, while custom rules can be shared via plugins namespaced `eslint-plugin-*`. The config modules are responsible for including the plugins and any of the plugins' rules that are to be enabled. Eslint provides more information on [working with plugins][2].

## Custom Rules
Before you start to write a custom rule, please review [Eslint's Architecture for rules][3]. 

Then, use Eslint's [work with rules document][4] to understand the eslint rule convensions. This document outlines rule basics, how to create rules with fixes, as well as how to write tests for custom rules.

It is recommended to use the [astexplorer web tool][5] to preview the AST generated by the Espress parser to help you understand the structure of the problamatic code your custom rule should be itentifying.
